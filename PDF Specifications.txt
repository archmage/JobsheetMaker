1. Overview
-----------

This document aims to serve as a technical speficiation for the PDF templates
and their usage.

2. Templates
------------

There are two PDFs that come with JobsheetMaker:

    - "Day Overview Template.pdf", used for the overview coversheet
    - "Single Job Template.pdf", used for each individual job sheet

As of the final submission they are included within the program file itself. 

Both templates contain a number of named fields that correspond to where the
data is placed during runtime. The name of the field is the sole determinant
of its corresponding data; in other words, the system is "template-agnostic" -
it does not care how the templates look, only that they have fields with the
expected names present.

This means that the existing templates may be replaced by custom ones, as long
as the new templates contain the right fields and field names.

3. Day Overview Template fields
-------------------------------

Here is a list of the fields and expected data present in "Day Overview
Template.pdf":

    - "Title": "Day Overview for ${worker.name}, ${job.date}"
    - "Client": "${client.name}"
    - "Contact": "${client.phone}"
    - "Address": "${client.address}"
    - "Services": "${job.services}"
    - "Comments": "${job.comments}"

4. Single Job Template fields
-----------------------------

Here is a list of the fields and expected data present in "Single Job
Template.pdf":

    - "Title": "${client.name} - ${job.services} on ${job.date}"
    - "Client": "${client.name}"
    - "Contact": "${client.phone}"
    - "Confirmed": "${job.confirmed}"
    - "Address": "${client.address}"
    - "Comments": "${job.comments}"
    - "Duration": "${job.duration}"
