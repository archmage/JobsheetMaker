# JobsheetMaker
JobsheetMaker is a _customised CSV to PDF converter_ that was originally developed to address a gap between a client's CRM features and their requirements. It was a project that was prototyped and pitched over around a week, then developed over two weeks and further supported over several months.

# Usage
JobsheetMaker is specifically designed to be used with [Malinko](http://www.malinkoapp.com/), a CRM system. _JobsheetMaker's entire functionality is dependent on Malinko and its provision of services_, and if anything were to break on Malinko's end, JobsheetMaker cannot be held accountable.

Users typically download CSV files for each Field Worker within Malinko, then run JobsheetMaker to load each CSV file. From there they can manage the PDF files that will be exported, using features such as checking against duplicates, selectively exporting, and deleting input files upon a successful export. A button is provided within the interface to view the export directory.

# Custom Templates
As detailed in `PDF Specifications.txt`, JobsheetMaker was designed to support custom PDF export templates. To use a custom template, simply place an appropriately-named PDF file in the same directory as JobsheetMaker, with matching field names, and JobsheetMaker will use it instead of the built-in default templates. For more info, please consult `PDF Specifications.txt`.
